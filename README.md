### Features

**Search Recipies:** You can search recipies within special guidlines and details

**Make Comments:** A fun feature we want to add is after completing a meal, users have the option to share their experience whether through a rating / comment / picture of their finished product! Adding the social aspect where users can share their meal with others and comment encouraging positive words we hope will be able to create a welcoming community of athletes who prioritize their nutrition well-being!
