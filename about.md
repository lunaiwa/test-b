<h2>What is Athlete Appetite ?</h2>

<h2> Our Mission </h2>

<p>Many student athletes find it really hard to make time in our schedule to plan and make food that we know is beneficial to our body and mind. We have heard many of our peers complain about being malnourished and not having the motivation to start up cooking/baking, so we want to try to provide a super simple and easy to use tool that can help get them started.</p>
